# 3D Integral Calculus Explorer

An interactive 3D educational tool designed to help students understand integral calculus through visualization and exploration.

## Overview

3D Integral Explorer provides an immersive environment where students can visualize and interact with mathematical concepts related to integral calculus. Through interactive 3D visualizations, students can develop intuitive understanding of areas under curves, volumes of revolution, and physical applications of integration.

## Features

- **Area Under Curve Playground**: Visualize how areas accumulate as you move along the x-axis
- **Volume Revolution Lab**: See how 2D shapes create 3D volumes when rotated around axes
- **Physics Integration**: Connect calculus to real-world applications with simulations
- **Interactive Controls**: Modify functions and immediately see the results
- **Educational Progression**: Gradual introduction of concepts through exploration
